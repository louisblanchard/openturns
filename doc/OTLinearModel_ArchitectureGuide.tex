This document makes up the general specification design for the general linear model stepwise regression analysis
in OpenTURNS.

\subsection{LinearModelAlgorithm}

\texttt{LinearModelAlgorithm} derive from \texttt{MetaModelAlgorithm}, with standard pimpl idiom
as prescribed by OpenTURNS coding rules.
