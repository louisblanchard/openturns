"Canonical monomial univariate polynomial family.

Available constructor:
    MonomialFactory()

Notes
-----
Any sequence of orthogonal polynomials has a recurrence formula relating any
three consecutive polynomials as follows:

.. math::

    P_{i + 1} = (a_i x + b_i) P_i + c_i P_{i - 1}, \quad 1 < i

The recurrence coefficients for the monomials come analytically and
read:

.. math::

    \begin{array}{rcl}
        a_i & = & 1 \\
        b_i & = & 0 \\
        c_i & = & 0
    \end{array}, \quad 1 < i
