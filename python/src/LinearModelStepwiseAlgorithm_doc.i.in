Notes
-----
This class is used in order to create a linear model from numerical samples, by using
the stepwise method. The linear regression model between the scalar variable :math:`Y`
and the :math:`n`-dimensional one :math:`\vect{X} = (X_i)_{i \leq n}` writes as follows:

.. math::

    \tilde{Y} = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n a_i X_i + \epsilon

where :math:`\epsilon` is the residual, supposed to follow the standard Normal
distribution.

Each coefficient :math:`a_i` is evaluated from both samples :math:`Ysample` and
:math:`Xsample` and is accompagnied by a confidence interval and a p-value (which
tests if they are significantly different from 0.0).

This class enables to test the quality of the model. It provides only numerical
tests. If :math:`X` is scalar, a graphical validation test exists, that draws
the residual couples :math:`(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_{i+1})`, where the residual
:math:`\epsilon_i` is evaluated on the samples :math:`(Xsample, Ysample)`:
:math:`\epsilon_i  = Ysample_i - \tilde{Y}_i` with
:math:`\tilde{Y}_i = a_0 + a_1 + Xsample_i`. The OpenTURNS method is 
:class:`~openturns.VisualTest_DrawLinearModelResidual`.
