Notes
-----
This class is used in order to create a linear model from numerical samples. The
linear regression model between the scalar variable :math:`Y` and the :math:`n`
-dimensional one :math:`\vect{X} = (X_i)_{i \leq n}` writes as follows:

.. math::

    \tilde{Y} = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n a_i X_i + \epsilon

where :math:`\epsilon` is the residual, supposed to follow the standard Normal
distribution.

Each coefficient :math:`a_i` is evaluated from both samples :math:`Ysample` and
:math:`Xsample` and is accompagnied by a confidence interval and a p-value (which
tests if they are significantly different from 0.0).

This class enables to test the quality of the model. It provides only numerical
tests. If :math:`X` is scalar, a graphical validation test exists, that draws
the residual couples :math:`(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_{i+1})`, where the residual
:math:`\epsilon_i` is evaluated on the samples :math:`(Xsample, Ysample)`:
:math:`\epsilon_i  = Ysample_i - \tilde{Y}_i` with
:math:`\tilde{Y}_i = a_0 + a_1 + Xsample_i`. The OpenTURNS method is 
:class:`~openturns.VisualTest_DrawLinearModelResidual`.

Notes
-----
The Chi-Square test is a goodness of fit test which objective is to check the normality assumption of residuals (and thus the model).

From a dataset :math:`\epsilon=(\epsilon_1,...,\epsilon_k)` of size :math:`k` (residual set), we define :math:`nClasses` classes
where :math:`nClasses := 2\ k^{\frac{2}{5}}`.

Under the normality hypothesis, we compute cumulative function of the :math:`\epsilon` set (mean and standard
deviation of the underlying normal distribution derive from the dataset). The interval :math:`[0, 1]` is then splited
onto :math:`nClasses` intervals.

For the Chi-Square test, two major elements are to be considered:
 - :math:`C_{i}` is the number of counted observations in the class :math:`i`
 - :math:`E_{i}` is the number of expected observations in the class :math:`i`

Using the cumulative information, we count number of elements in each class ( :math:`C_{i}` )
Also, under the null hypothesis, the different classes are equiprobable ( :math:`E_{i}\ =\ E\ =\frac{k}{nClasses}`

From the previous values per class, we compute the Pearson test statistic :math:`P=\sum_{i=1}^{nClasses} \frac{C_{i} - E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}}`

Finally, the p-value is computed thanks to a chi-square distribution with :math:`nClasses - 3` degrees of freedom."
